# My Personal Website

This project has been created using the Svelte framework, written in TypeScript.

I kept the application as simple and streamlined as possible, so there's no routing or js in css etc. This project was about trying out Svelte and learning a new framework rather than flexing my knowledge in a familiar framework such as React.
